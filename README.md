# Student-Management-System

ðŸ“Œ Project: Student Management System (Java-Only)
ðŸ”¹ Description
The Student Management System is a Java-based console application that helps manage student records efficiently. This program enables users to add, view, update, search, and delete student details. It is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, particularly Encapsulation and Collections (ArrayList).

This system does not require a database; instead, it stores student records dynamically in an ArrayList. The program runs in a menu-driven format, allowing users to interact with it seamlessly through the console.

ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ” Add a Student â€“ Users can enter student details (ID, Name, Age, Grade).
âœ” Display All Students â€“ Shows all student records stored in memory.
âœ” Search for a Student â€“ Find a student by ID.
âœ” Update Student Details â€“ Modify existing student information.
âœ” Delete a Student â€“ Remove a student from the system using their ID.
âœ” Exit Option â€“ Allows users to terminate the program.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
Java (Core Java)
Collections Framework (ArrayList)
OOP Concepts (Encapsulation, Constructors, Methods)
Exception Handling (Input Handling with Scanner)
ðŸ”¹ How It Works?
The program starts by displaying a menu with various options.
Users can select an option (e.g., Add, Search, Update, Delete).
Input is taken through Scanner, and data is stored in an ArrayList<Student>.
The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
